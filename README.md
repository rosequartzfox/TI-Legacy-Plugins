# TI: Legacy MUSHclient Plugins
Plugins for The Inquisition: Legacy RP MUD.

## What the Plugins Do
### Too Far Away
Adapted from Galaban's version to accommodate TI, this plugin will automatically move toward another player or NPC if you attempt to hand something to them and they're too far away to receive it.
### Emote Checker
Written by The Last Good Dragon specifically for TI, this plugin allows you to review things like line spacing, quotation marks, targets, and stat/skill checks before submitting your emote or rpecho. Once installed it happens automatically. Try emoting or using rpecho to see it work. Plugin also supports attack, defend, and safe commands â€” attempting to attack an invalid location displays a warning message.
### Ritual Emotes
Written by Niamh for TI. When there is a second player in the room with you you have to supply an emote when using rituals. As you tend to use multiple rituals in quick succession in order to evoke a spell, this causes a lot of folks to just use a period in the stead of the emotes, which is boring. These add, with flavor from the helpfiles on each ritual, an emote per ritual that is automatically generated and printed to the room. Once installed, syntax is viewable with "rithelp."
### Color Copy
Adapted from Fiendish's version to work with TI color codes, this plugin allows you to highlight any text in your MUSHclient window, then ctrl+left click to copy it to your clipboard with color codes intact. Especially handy for crafters or book-binders.
